\section{Verification of primal DG}

Since I was not able to get the DG code working at the time of the first project, I found it helpful to verify that this new implementation works as expected.

As a reminder, the three problems are given by
\begin{align}
-u_{xx} &= x^2 \\
-10^{-4} u_{xx} + u &= 0 \\
-10^{-2} u_{xx} + u_x &= 0,
\end{align}
where the boundary conditions for all three are $u(0) = 0$ and $u(1) = 1$.
Analytical solutions to the three problems are given by
\begin{align}
u(x) &= \frac{x}{12} \left( 13 - x^3 \right) \\
u(x) &= \frac{\exp(100x) - \exp(-100x)}{\exp(100) - \exp(-100)} \\
u(x) &= \frac{1 - \exp(100x)}{1 - \exp(100)}\\
\end{align}
respectively.
